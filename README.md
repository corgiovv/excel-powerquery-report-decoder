# Excel Power Query Report Decoder

This repository contains an Excel Power Query (M language) solution for processing standardised Excel report templates submitted by multiple organisations.

The solution dynamically loads multiple Excel files from a selected folder, extracts organisation metadata, and transforms semi-structured report sections into analysis-ready tables.

## Project structure
- `power_query/functions/` — reusable Power Query (M) functions
- `power_query/sections/` — section-level queries for each report sheet
- `docs/` — project documentation
